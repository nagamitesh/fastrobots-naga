    <p class="homepage-hero-subtitle">Hi, this is my page for ECE 4160 Fast Robots at Cornell University.  I am a Junior at Cornell University majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Electrical Engineering. I’m passionate about all things aerospace and am currently the Structures Lead of Cornell Rocketry, a student-run project team focusing on building and launching a 10000 foot apogee hybrid rocket. I’m also really passionate about robotics, biking, and drumming, and you can find me in Lincoln Hall many times a week playing percussion!</p>
